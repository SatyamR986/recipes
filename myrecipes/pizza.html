    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pizza[a][1] is an Italian, specifically Neapolitan, dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomato, cheese, and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.</p>
    <p>Pizza and its variants are among the most popular foods in the world. Pizza is sold at a variety of restaurants, including pizzerias (pizza specialty restaurants), Mediterranean restaurants, via delivery, and as street food.[9] In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.[10][11] In casual settings, however, it is typically cut into slices to be eaten while held in the hand. Pizza is also sold in grocery stores in a variety of forms, including frozen or as kits for self-assembly. Store-bought pizzas are then cooked using a home oven.</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl or cup, mix the yeast with warm water. Add some sugar to speed the process up. Sift the flour, add garlic powder and salt... mix all properly to distribute the salt evenly. Add the olive oil.</li>
        <li>Once the yeast activates, pour it into the flour mixture and start mixing. I'm using a stand mixer, but you can also do it by hand. Give it 5 minutes at least, 10 is better. Tip: Do not add all flour at once, reserve a cup for later. Each flour type absorbs water in a different way. The dough is ready when it separates from the mixing bowl. Let the dough proof in a large bowl covered with foil or a cover. 1-2 hours is the minimum time, for the best results, let it slowly ferment in your fridge overnight.</li>
        <li>Once the dough has risen, it's time to form the crust. As I mentioned earlier, this batch will yield 3-4 large crusts. Store the un-used dough covered in the fridge for 3 or even 5 days... yes, I tried to use a 5-day old dough with great results. Flour the working surface, form a ball and divide it into 3-4 smaller pieces.</li>
        <li>Start by using your fingers and knuckles. Feel free to use a roller, but do not run over the edges, you want them to remain thick. This way, the final pizza will have nice puffy and crispy edge full of air pockets.</li>
        <li>As an absolute minimum, you have to use a tomato-based sauce and cheese. I used simple tomato puree for this one, sprinkled with a bit of dried oregano to give a nice fragrant touch. Mozzarella cheese is the right one to use, shredded or fresh.</li>
        <li>I totally love prosciutto and this is what I'm using for this pizza. Simply tear it by hand and distribute evenly. Next come sliced shallots, jalapenos, cherry tomatoes and a fee sliced of camembert cheese. But really, you can use whatever you like :)</li>
        <li>he golden rule here, preheat your oven to the max temperature it is capable of reaching. For most of us, that's 250 Celsius or 450 Fahrenheit. The baking process will take about 15-20 minutes, based on the max temperature of your oven. Aim for nicely browned edge and golden brown cheese bits. And we are done!</li>
