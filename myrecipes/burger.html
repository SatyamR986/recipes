    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A hamburger (or simply a burger) consists of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. The patties are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chilis with condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish or a "special sauce", often a variation of Thousand Island dressing, and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger patty topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.[1] Under some definitions, and in some cultures, a hamburger is considered a sandwich.</p>
        <p>Hamburgers are typically associated with fast-food restaurants and diners but are also sold at other restaurants, including high-end establishments. There are many international and regional variations of hamburgers. Some of the largest multinational fast-food chains feature burgers as one of their core products: McDonald's Big Mac and Burger King's Whopper have become global icons of American culture.[2][3]</p>
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 pound meat</li>
            <li>1/2 cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.</li>
            <li>Whisk egg, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Add meat and bread crumbs; mix with your hands or a fork until well blended.</li>
            <li>Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.</li>
            <li>Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
