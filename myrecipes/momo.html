    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Momos[a] are a type of steamed filled dumpling in Tibetan[1] and Nepali cuisine[2] that is also popular in neighbouring Bhutan, Bangladesh, and India.[3][4] The majority of Tibetan momos are half-moon in shape like jiaozi, while Nepali momos are normally round like baozi.[5][6] Momos are usually served with a sauce known as achar influenced by the spices and herbs used within many South Asian cuisines. It can also be used in soup, as in jhol momo and mokthuk.</p>
    <p>Legend holds that 7th-century Nepali princess Bhrikuti, who introduced Buddhism to Tibet, also introduced momos there.[13] Despite that, it is generally believed that the concept of dumplings was carried from China by the Mongols in the 13th century.[14][7][6] As for the Himalayan momo, similar to the history of Korean mandu, the history of momos in Nepal dates back to as early as the fourteenth century.[15][16] It is not quite known whether it spread from the Kathmandu valley of Nepal to Tibet or the other way around. Because this dish was initially popular among the Newar community of the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal, one prevalent belief is that traveling Nepali Newar merchants took the recipe from Tibet, where they traded, and brought it home to Nepal.[17] In Tibet, the filling of the dish was typically meat, such as yak and occasionally potatoes and cheese. Traditional Tibetan momos are quite different from the Nepalese one as the former was made with a thicker dough and with little to no spices except salt.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 1/2 pounds ground chicken thighs</li>
